# TELESTO-weather-allsky


## This is the Github repository for the code of the semester project at Sauverny's Observatory.

The code for this project can be divided into 3 main parts, you will find it in the 3 main directories:

* /home/pi/**weather**: This directory contains all the code necessary to run the weather station, generate plots and save the data.
* /home/pi/**allsky**: This directory contains all the code necessary to run the All-Sky camera.
* /var/www/**html**: This directory contains all the code necessary to run the lighttpd server.


## The code and build of this project was mainly inspired by:

* The excellent project of Thomas Jacquin which can be consulted on https://github.com/thomasjacquin/allsky

* The Raspberry Pi Fundation weather station project which is available at : https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/build-your-own-weather-station
